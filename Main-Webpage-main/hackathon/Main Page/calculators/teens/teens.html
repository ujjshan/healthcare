      <h4>Why a BMI calculator for teens</h4>
      <p>
        In fact, we at Omni have created a total of 5 BMI calculators that
        include a general BMI calculator (jack of all trades, master of none) as
        well as specific BMI calculators for men, women, kids, and teens. Feel
        free to use the one that best suits your needs by following the links
        below: <br />
        <br />

        General BMI calculator <br />
        <br />
        BMI calculator for men <br /><br />
        BMI calculator for women and BMI calculator for kids (boys and girls up
        to 10 years old).
      </p>
      <h4>BMI, statistics and percentiles</h4>
      <p>
        It is useless to talk about BMI without a point of reference or
        comparison. In fact, BMI was always designed to be a statistical
        comparison tool to assess the state of a person's body. We have talked
        in great detail about the flaws of a statistical tool for assessing the
        health of one individual in the general BMI calculator, but as long as
        we set some constraints, BMI can still be useful. <br />
        <br />

        The first thing to know is that BMI is meant as a measurement for
        sedentary people. This means that athletes and very active people might
        have "unhealthy" BMI values despite being totally healthy. The second
        thing to note is that BMI doesn't consider body types and body shapes,
        so if you have an uncommon or extreme body type, your BMI might not be a
        good indicator of your health.
      </p>
      <h4>BMI chart for teens and its relevance</h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to determining what a healthy BMI for teens is, BMI charts
        rule, quite literally. What we mean by that is that BMI charts for teens
        are actually the medical way to determine whether a teenager has a
        healthy body mass index or if they are at risk. These charts (shown
        below) are different for boys and girls and present a visualization of
        the percentiles we mentioned in the previous section.

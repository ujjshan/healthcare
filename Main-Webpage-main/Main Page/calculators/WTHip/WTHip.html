      <h4>Why is waist-hip ratio important?</h4>
      <p>
        The waist-hip ratio is generally an indicator or measure of health and
        the risk of developing serious health conditions, such as diabetes,
        asthma, or Alzheimer's disease. Research shows that people with
        "apple-shaped" bodies (with more weight around the waist) face more
        health risks than those with "pear-shaped" bodies who carry more weight
        around the hips. Check your body shape with our body shape calculator.
        <br />

        Waist-hip ratio is used as a measurement of obesity. The WHO states that
        abdominal obesity is defined as a waist-hip ratio above 0.90 for males
        and above 0.85 for females or a body mass index (BMI) above 30. Visit
        our BMI calculator to learn more.
      </p>
      <h4>How should I measure waist and hips?</h4>
      <p>
        It's more complicated than you might think: <br />
        <br />
        According to the WHO's data gathering protocol, we should use a
        stretch-resistant tape to measure the waist circumference at the
        midpoint between the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest.
        Hip circumference should be measured around the widest portion of the
        buttocks, with the tape parallel to the floor. <br />
        Practically, the measurements are usually taken at the smallest
        circumference of the natural waist, usually just above the belly button
        and the widest part of the buttocks or hip.
      </p>
      <h4>How do I calculate the waist to hip ratio?</h4>
      <p>
        Do you wish to learn more about calculating the waist-to-hip ratio by
        hand? To calculate the waist-to-hip ratio, we use the following formula:
        Ratio = W รท H.
        <br />
        <br />

        In this formula, W refers to the circumference of the waist and H
        represents the circumference of the hip.
        <br />

        For example, a person with a 28 in (71 cm) waist and 35 in (89 cm) hips
        has a waist-hip ratio of 28/35 = 0.8 in
        <br />

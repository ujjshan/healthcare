      <h4>Why BMI for kids?</h4>
      <p>
        We often say that kids are just tiny people, and in many ways, they are.
        But in terms of physical development, they are still in the making,
        which means that a lot of the rules and risks that apply to adults don't
        apply to kids. The same is true for the BMI of kids. When we are talking
        about the BMI for boys or the BMI for girls, many factors make it
        virtually impossible to compare them sensibly to an adult.
        <br />

        At Healthify, we took this into account, and we have separated our BMI
        calculators into 5 groups. These include a general BMI calculator and
        other calculators specific for each of the most easily divisible
        population groups: women, men, teens, and children. If you are looking
        for one of our other calculators, here are links to all of them:
        <br />

        General BMI calculator<br />
        <br />
        BMI calculator for Adults <br />

        <br />
        and BMI calculator for teenagers. <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h4>BMI chart for kids and the healthy BMI for kids</h4>
      <p>
        In some of our other BMI calculators, we mention the statistical nature
        of BMI and its inherent problem when using it as a diagnostic tool. For
        kids, however, this problem is exacerbated. When looking at BMI for boys
        or BMI for girls, doctors always use a percentile BMI chart for children
        so they know how beneficial the results are. We will explain later what
        percentiles are, but for now, know that it's a tool used to compare an
        individual with the rest of the population.
      </p>
      <h4>How to use the BMI calculator for kids</h4>
      <p>
        Calculating the BMI for children by hand is not very difficult, but we
        have made it even simpler with our BMI calculator for girls and boys.
        Using our calculator will save time and avoid mistakes when comparing
        the obtained values with the BMI charts for kids. <br />

        Here are the steps for using the BMI calculator for kids effectively:
        <br />

        Input the kid's height (the units don't matter because the calculator
        will convert them to the right ones for the equation). <br />
        <br />
        Input the kid's weight (choose the units you love the most). <br />
        <br />
        The values for BMI prime and BMI for girls and boys will be computed
        immediately. <br />
        <br />
        Input how old the child is in years. <br />
        <br />
        Input the sex of the child to obtain the right percentiles. <br />
        <br />
        The percentiles and categorization according to the BMI for kids will be
        displayed as text. <br />
        <br />
